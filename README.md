# ECMS
ECMS Means Enviromental Cleaning Managment System. With this system, we intend to work for the cleanliness of the neighborhoods that we are registering as houses, tenants and communities. After each house or tenant, a service will be provided for which a fee will be charged and there is a fixed fee for that service and deliver every month. Not only that, the system has a manager who will have users whose job it is to release the captured data so that it can be easily accessed later.
